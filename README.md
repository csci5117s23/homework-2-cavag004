## Homework Notes

I was not able to successfully complete all of the required homework tasks. I spent a lot of time trying to get crud working but was unable to integrate that into my project. The add button does work, and does push information using the REST API. I was not able to get update, read, and delete working. If you look at my code, todos.js has my attempt at read. And I ran out of time to get update and delete.
Beacuse read does not work, /done and /todo:id do not work because I could not get one item from the database.

I spent so much time on crud that I could not get user auth working at all, and the stuff I did have is just comented out.

I started on this assignment immediately, I built the front end first because all of the information for the backend was not told and demonstrated to us yet. I found it very difficult to implent the backend after I made my front end. Some people I talked to waited until we had everything for the backend and did the front end last. I would like to focus more on that in the future. Pretending information is there is not a great way to develope an application, becuase I found that I can't always represent the data in the way that I wanted.
